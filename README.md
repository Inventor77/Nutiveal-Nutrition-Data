# Hacktoberfest Guidelines

## New in Hacktoberfest 2022

This year Hacktoberfest encourages low-code and non-code contributions, which can be done through writing techincal documentation, design, testing, and [many more](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code). The contributions must be tracked throught Github Pull Requests (PRs) as other type of contributions.

## How to Participate in Hacktoberfest 2022?

### Registration

Hacktober registration opens on 26th September. You will get the option to choose whether you're participating as a contributor or as a maintainer.

### Participating as a Contributor

You have to make four PRs from 1st October to 31st October that either:
* Are merged into a participating repository.
* Or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.
* Or have an approving review, but not closed or draft.

Partcipating repository are those that has the `hacktoberfest` topic.
You can participate through Github or Gitlab.

### Participating as a Maintainer

As a Maintainer, you must facilitate participation for contributors. You should either:
* Add the `hacktoberfest` topic to your repository.
* Or add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label into your repository to be used on pull requests.

Then, you must merge four PRs into your repository between 1st to 31st October. If you decide to use the second option mentioned in the first step, make sure to add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label into these PRs.

### Rules

1. The PRs will only count into your participation which are merged between October 1st to October 31st.
2. Contributions must be made to public repositories.
3. PR with label as `spam` or `invalid` will not be counted. And, if a participant has 2 or more spam PRs, they'll be disqualified from Hacktoberfest.

## Tips

### For Contributors

1. Avoid spamming: Hacktoberfest is a busy season for maintainers, so they'll highly likely take time to take a look at your PR. Spamming maintainers does not speed up the process and only ruins the experience for maintainers.
2. Make valuable contributions: During Hacktoberfest, many repositories are created with the purpose of participating in Hacktoberfest but without providing any value. For example, repositories where you just contribute by adding your name to a list. A lot of these repositories are caught by Hacktoberfest eventually, are disqualified, and contributions from them are labeled as invalid. There's no point in wasting time on this.
3. Follow the guidelines: Projects should have contributing guidelines that explain how you can contribute to them. Make sure you read those first before you contribute.

### For Maintainers

1. Make contributing guidelines: Whether you have a small or big project, contributing guidelines make it easier for your contributors to know how they can contribute to your project.
2. Welcome all developers: Many beginner developers participate in Hacktoberfest. They may lack experience when it comes to contributing, but they're eager to do it. Make sure to be welcoming to all developers of different experiences. If possible, try creating issues of different levels of expertise.
