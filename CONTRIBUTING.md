### Participating as a Contributor

* Are merged into a participating repository.
* Or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.
* Or have an approving review, but not closed or draft.

You can participate through Github or Gitlab.

### Participating as a Maintainer

As a Maintainer, you must facilitate participation for contributors. You should either:
* Add the `hacktoberfest` topic to your repository.
* Or add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label into your repository to be used on pull requests.

Then, you must merge four PRs into your repository between 1st to 31st October. If you decide to use the second option mentioned in the first step, make sure to add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label into these PRs.

### Rules

1. The PRs will only count into your participation which are merged between October 1st to October 31st.
2. Contributions must be made to public repositories.
3. PR with label as `spam` or `invalid` will not be counted. And, if a participant has 2 or more spam PRs, they'll be disqualified from Hacktoberfest.
